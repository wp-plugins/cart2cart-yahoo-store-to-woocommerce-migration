== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I migrate my category structure to WooCommerce =
Since Yahoo! Store permits merchants to create a category structure manually, it is usually different from the one on WooCommerce store. And if the category structure on source and target carts do not match, the plugin will not migrate this particular entity.

= After the migration from Yahoo! Store the quantity of each of my products is incorrect. Why is that?=
Due to Yahoo! Store peculiarities the exact quantity of each product can not be transferred and the cart will automatically set it to 1000 after the migration.

 = Do you migrate customer’s credit cards information? =
Unfortunately, migrations of credit card’s data are not supported, however such entities as customer’s billing and shipping addresses will be migrated automatically.
= Will my current Yahoo! Store be online during the migration ? =
Cart2Cart transfer will by no means interrupt the activity of your source shopping cart, thus Yahoo! Store will active during the entire migration procedure
